//arduino code for four channel four way relay  where each channel is connected to 4 LEDs in parallel and pins of arduino board utilized four 4 relays are pins 13,12,11,10. Realy should work to produce a wave motion
//For the 16 LEDs connected pin 10 connected to LEDs 1,5,9,13; pin 11 connected to LEDs 2,6,10,14; pin 12 connected to LEDs 3,7,11,15; pin 13 connected to LEDs 4,8,12,16
